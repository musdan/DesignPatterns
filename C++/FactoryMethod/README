This is C++ version of the "Abstract Factory" pattern in PHP 
to create Objects of different Bike types, that I 
had checkedin sometime back.

This is a complete sample project that can be compiled 
and run by copying the tasks.json settings into your
Visual Code project accordingly.


On building the project, a executable named "TestBikeFactory" is 
generated that can be run by just invoking it in the main
directory by ./TestBikeFactory or by giving the complete path to
the executable.
